#[Rhyme Remix](http://www.rhymeremix.com/)

This application generates raps using single rhyming lines from random rap songs.

Rhymes are identied based on the syllables in the last word in the line. You can see how the rap rhyme databsae was created in the [Rap Rhymer](https://github.com/mikekaminsky/RapRhymer) repository.

[Steve Ellis](http://steveell.is/) contributed lots of help getting this from a simple command line tool onto the web.
